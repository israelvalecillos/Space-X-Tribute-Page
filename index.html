                SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the aim of reducing the costs of traveling to space to
                facilitate the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles,
                the Starlink constellation, the Dragon cargo ship, and brought astronauts to the International Space
                Station on Dragon 2.
